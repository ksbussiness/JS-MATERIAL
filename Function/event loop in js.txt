ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT $$ EVENT LOOP :
--------------------------------------------- >

EVENT LOOP IN JS:-
--------------------- >
.> The Event Loop is the mechanism in JavaScript that allows non-blocking, asynchronous code to run by continuously checking the Call Stack and the Task Queues, and pushing tasks to the Call Stack when it is empty.

.> JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can do one thing at a time.
The event loop helps JS handle async operations like setTimeout, promises, and API calls without blocking the main thread.

## ## ## ::--> 
        Call Stack – Executes functions
        Web APIs – Handles async operations (timers, fetch, DOM events)
        Microtask Queue – Promises (.then, await)
        Task (Callback) Queue – setTimeout, setInterval
        Event Loop – Coordinates everything


EX:
        console.log("Start");
        setTimeout(() => {
          console.log("Timeout");
        }, 0);
        Promise.resolve().then(() => {
          console.log("Promise");
        });
        console.log("End");

ANSWERS: 
        Start
        End
        Promise
        Timeout

        console.log("Start") → Call Stack → prints Start
        setTimeout → sent to Web API
        Promise.then → goes to Microtask Queue
        console.log("End") → Call Stack → prints End
        Call Stack is empty
        Event Loop runs Microtasks first → prints Promise
        Then Task Queue → prints Timeout

NOTE:-
    > Microtasks always execute before Tasks
    > The event loop ensures that asynchronous JavaScript code runs efficiently by executing microtasks first, then tasks, when the call stack is empty.

await does NOT block JavaScript
It only pauses the async function, not the entire program.
    >  await pauses the async function and schedules the rest of the code as a microtask, which runs before any setTimeout callbacks.
    >  No. await only pauses the async function. The rest of JavaScript continues to execute.

  async → Promise-based function
  await → “pause here, continue later as microtask”
  Microtasks → always before setTimeout

function a(){
    console.log("a");
    
}

a();

console.log("end")

.> browser has the js engine in it and 

.> js engine has the call stack in it 

.> inside the call stack code sruns here.



what is the WEB API,

..> set Timeout() 
..> DOM manipulations Apis 
..> fetch ()
..> local storage
..> console.
..> location  


.> all these super powers are not part of teh js , but they are part of the BROWSER .

..> BROWSER give access to the js engine in side teh call stack to use them and access them via the global object.(window)

when we write the console.log("hai iam ok"), then internally this line calls the web api , and then this web api call the console.log functionality of teh browser



console.log("start")

setTimeout(function(cb){
    console.log("callbACK..!")
},5000);

console.log("ENd...!");

..> here first console.log("start") this line will be executed and by calling the web apis and , this web api will be called to the browsers console features,

then an GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXt will be created and then , by using the the first line will be created 

..> then next it will encounter the setTimeout() here it has 5000 delay , js ia syncronous then it will go to the next line insted of weighting for the this delay to complete.

..> next it will encounter the console.log("ENd...!"); , then has discussed above it will be executed it in the same way.


..> then GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXt will be deleted from the call stack,


..> after the delay has completed , the setTimeout will be  giev to the CALL QUEUE ..> it will store the setTimeout, after delay has been completed then it need to be executed , but it can not executed directly ,  

..> EVENT LOOP , here connects the call stack and the call back QUEUE, 

..> EVENT LOOP , here will checks for the any thing is there for the execution in the call back queue , if any is there then it wll be executes them 

..> EVENT loop acts has the gate keeper between the CALL-STACK and the callback Queue

..> 



console.log("Start");

document.getElementById("btn")
.addEventListener("click",function cb(){
    console.log("callback");
})

console.log("ENds....!");

..> here also the console.log("Start") hits then it will be executed has the same has disccued in above 

..> when this hits document.getElementById("btn")
 then this DOM api of the WEB API will be triggered, then next , it will store the  cb() in the web Api only, its been hits here like some body to call the cb() functions externally.
 
 ..> here cb() function will present in side the WEB api untill thw browser is cloed or , externally deleted the funtion
 
 
 ..> js does not wait for any thing so it will be next line here in this case console.log("ENds....!"); after executing it the GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT will be deleted.
 
 
 ..> when user click on the event listner, then cb() which is present in side the WEB APIs will go in to the CALLBACK QUEUE.
 
 ..> know the cb() is present in side the callback queue which is ready to executed
 
 EVENT LOOP it will continuously moniter the CALL-BACK STACK and CALL-BACK QUEUE,
 
 
 ..> If some is there inside the call back queue to execute then EVENTLOOP  will be fetche it from the callback queue and sends it to call stcak to executes it .
 
 ..> after fetching from the callback queue and , executing it via event loop, it will be deleted from the callback queue.
 
 
 *****
 we can get a doubt here like EVENT LOOP can directly take the fetch the cb(_) function from the WEB API instead of having the call back Queue .
 
 here , CallBack Queue, is need beacuse , when user click 7-8 times continously the button then in side the 

 CallBack Queue : call the cb() function calls needed to be stored like this.
 
 cb(1) cb(2) cb(3) cb(4)p cb(5) cb(6) cb(7) cb(8)  , event loop fetches them from the call back queue and executes them .
 
 ..> 
 
 
 fetch(): it is an web api feature which is used to make the API Request.
 
 
 console.log("starting");
 
 setTimeout(function cbT(){
     console.log("CB SetTimeOut");
 },5000);
 
 fetch("http://api.netflix.com")
 .then(function cbF(){
     console.log("CB Netflix");
 });
 
 console.log("end...");
 
 .> when this line hits console.log("starting"); , in xame way has discuued it be executed 
 
 ..> setTimeout(function cbT(){ , when this line hits then the cbT() will go and stores in side the WEB API , and waits for teh delay to end
 
 ..>  fetch("http://api.netflix.com") , when this line hits then cbF will be stored inside the  WEB API 
 
 
 
 ..> js does not waits for any thing.
 
 ..>   console.log("end..."); it will executs it , 
 
 
 .> we have the two QUESE in js :
 
 
 MicroTaskQueue:
 ---------------->
 ..> the tasks which are present here have the higher priority , then the task in the  CallBackQueue.
 
 ..> 
 
 CallBackQueue:
 ---------------->
 
 ..> having the less priority tasks here
 
 
 ..> so the CBF fetch function will go in to the  MicroTaskQueue
 
 ..> the CBT  function will go in to the   CallBackQueue:
 
 and the EVENT LOOP will continuously     moniter teh micro task queue and teh call back queue.
 
 ..> so teh call stack is empty , so it take teh CBF fomr teh MicroTaskQueue and executes it and next it will take the CBT from   CallBackQueue and executes it .
 
 
 ****** 
 NOTE :
 
..> all the call back functions which comes through the Promises will go to the 
MicroTaskQueue and mutation observer will goes in to  the MicroTaskQueue

 CallBackQueue: all other functions call back functions, setTimeout and other functionsn will go in to the CallBackQueue
 
 
 
 
 CallBackQueue also called has the TASK QUeue.
