How Does Function Execution Work in JavaScript?


When JavaScript runs, it starts in the Global Execution Context (GEC).

The GEC is created by default and contains:

Global Object (window in browsers or global in Node.js).

this keyword pointing to the global object.

 Example: Global Execution Context

let x = 10;
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}

greet();
When the code starts:

x is stored in memory.

greet() function is stored in memory.

The greet() function is called and creates a new Function Execution Context (FEC).

.>  Function Call Creates a New Execution Context
When you call a function, JavaScript creates a Function Execution Context (FEC) and pushes it onto the Call Stack.

# FEC Contains:

Variable Environment (VE): Stores variables and functions inside the function.

Lexical Environment: Maintains reference to the outer scope.

this Binding: Refers to the object that invoked the function.

Example: Creating Function Execution Context

function add(a, b) {
  let sum = a + b;
  return sum;
}

let result = add(5, 10);
console.log(result); // 15


# Execution Flow:
--------------------- > 

Global Execution Context is created.

add(5, 10) is called.

A new FEC is created for add().

a and b are stored in the local memory.

sum is calculated and returned.

add() finishes and its context is popped off the call stack.

Control goes back to the Global Execution Context.

# Step 3: Call Stack – Keeps Track of Function Calls
The Call Stack is a data structure that keeps track of function calls.

 How It Works:

When a function is called, it is pushed onto the call stack.

When the function completes, it is popped off the stack.

Example: Multiple Functions in Call Stack

function first() {
  console.log("First");
  second();
  console.log("First Done");
}

function second() {
  console.log("Second");
  third();
  console.log("Second Done");
}

function third() {
  console.log("Third");
}

first();

# Call Stack Flow:

first() is pushed onto the stack.

second() is called inside first() – pushed onto the stack.

third() is called inside second() – pushed onto the stack.

third() finishes – popped off the stack.

second() finishes – popped off the stack.

first() finishes – popped off the stack.

 Output:


First
Second
Third
Second Done
First Done

# Step 4: Memory Creation Phase (Hoisting) :

Before executing the code, JavaScript goes through the Memory Creation Phase, where:

Variables are assigned undefined.

Function declarations are stored in memory.

 Example: Hoisting in Action


console.log(x); // undefined
greet();        // Hello!

var x = 5;

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

 Explanation:

var x is hoisted and set to undefined.

greet() is hoisted with its function definition.

Code execution happens after this.

 Step 5: Execution Phase (Line-by-Line Execution)
After the memory phase, JavaScript starts the execution phase, where:

It assigns values to variables.

Executes functions when they are called.

 Example: Memory and Execution Phase

var x = 10;
function multiply(num) {
  return num * 2;
}

let result = multiply(x);
console.log(result); // 20

# Execution Flow:

x is assigned 10.

multiply() is called.

New Execution Context is created for multiply().

num gets value 10, and returns 20.

multiply() is popped off the call stack.

# Step 6: Return and Pop Execution Context
When a function completes, its execution context is popped off the stack and control returns to the calling function.

 Example: Return and Pop from Stack


function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

function calculate(x, y) {
  let product = multiply(x, y);
  console.log(product);
}

calculate(5, 4);

..> Call Stack Flow:

calculate(5, 4) is called.

multiply(5, 4) is called inside calculate().

multiply() returns 20 and is popped off the stack.

calculate() prints 20 and is popped off the stack.


20
# Step 7: Lexical Scope and Closures
Each function maintains a lexical scope (outer scope reference), which allows:

Access to variables from parent scopes.

Creation of closures.

 Example: Lexical Scope and Closure

function outer() {
  let x = 10;

  function inner() {
    console.log(x); // Accesses x from outer()
  }

  return inner;
}

let closureFunc = outer();
closureFunc(); // 10
Explanation:

inner() retains access to x from outer() due to closure.

 Final Recap: Function Execution Workflow
 1. Global Execution Context (GEC)

Created when JavaScript starts.

Contains global variables and functions.

 2. Memory Creation Phase (Hoisting)

Variables get undefined.

Functions are stored in memory.

 3. Code Execution Phase

Code runs line by line.

Functions are called and pushed onto the call stack.

 4. Function Execution Context (FEC)

Created when a function is invoked.

Contains:

Local variables

Arguments

Lexical environment

5. Call Stack Management

Functions are pushed onto the call stack when called.

Popped off the stack when finished.

 6. Return and Pop

Control returns to the calling function after completion.

Execution context is destroyed.

Complete Example with Full Workflow:
------------------------------------- > 

function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}

function main() {
  let user = "John";
  greet(user);
  console.log("Main function done");
}

main();

Call Stack Flow:

main() is called → Push to stack.

greet() is called → Push to stack.

greet() finishes → Pop from stack.

main() finishes → Pop from stack.

 Output:

Hello, John

Main function done


What is the Use of Closures in JavaScript?
A closure is created when a function remembers and accesses variables from its outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing.

 Main Purpose of Closures:
 Data Privacy: Closures allow private variables, which can’t be accessed directly from outside.
 State Persistence: A closure can “remember” values between function calls.
 Callback and Event Handling: Often used in event listeners, timers, and callbacks.
 Encapsulation: Helps in organizing and structuring code more efficiently.

 How Does a Closure Work?
When a function is defined inside another function, it forms a closure. The inner function remembers the variables from its outer function, even after the outer function has returned.


function outer() {
  let x = 10; // x is in the outer function's scope

  function inner() {
    console.log(x); // inner() uses x from outer()
  }

  return inner;
}

let closureFunc = outer(); // outer() is called and returns inner()
closureFunc(); // 10

 Explanation:

outer() is executed, and x is initialized to 10.

inner() is returned by outer() but still remembers the variable x due to closure.

When closureFunc() is called, it accesses x from the outer scope.

 Call Stack and Closure Memory Flow (Step by Step)
 Step 1: Global Execution Context (GEC) is Created

Global object (window in browsers or global in Node.js) is created.

closureFunc is declared but assigned undefined initially.

 Step 2: outer() is Called


let closureFunc = outer();
New Function Execution Context (FEC) is created for outer().

outer() creates x = 10 in its local memory.

inner() is defined but not executed.

inner is returned to closureFunc.

 Step 3: Outer Context is Popped but Lexical Scope is Preserved
Even though outer() finishes and is popped off the call stack, its lexical environment (where x = 10 exists) is preserved due to the closure.

 Step 4: closureFunc() is Called

closureFunc(); // 10
A new FEC is created for inner().

inner() accesses x from the outer scope, thanks to closure.

console.log(x) prints 10.

inner() finishes and is popped off the stack.


javascript
Copy
Edit
function outer() {
  let x = 10;

  function inner() {
    console.log(x);
  }

  return inner;
}

let closureFunc = outer(); // Call outer() and get inner()
closureFunc(); // Call inner()

 Why Closures are Useful?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++>

 1. Data Privacy with Closures

function secretCounter() {
  let count = 0;

  return function () {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

let counter = secretCounter();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
counter(); // 3



count is private and cannot be accessed directly.

Only counter() can modify and access count.


function outer(){
    let x=10; // Lexical scope starts here
    console.log("from outer",x)
    function inner(){
        console.log(x) // x is accessible here due to lexical scope
    }
    return inner
    console.log("from outer after inner")
}

let sun=outer() // outer() ends, but closure keeps x alive.

sun(); // 10

sun=null; Now, x is no longer accessible.

..> here let sun=outer() fomr this line we call the outer  function the outer function is called , and outer() returns the inner function, so now sun is a reference to the inner function.

..> when use write the sun() then we get the result 10 in the out even after the outer function is executed.
 


..>Lexica scope means that a function's scope is determined by where it is defined in the source code, not where it is executed.

..> inner() tries to access x. Since x is not defined inside inner(), JavaScript looks up the scope chain to find x in the outer function (outer()).

..> Lexical scope is static — it does not change even if the function is executed in a different context.

..> A closure allows a function to remember the scope in which it was defined.

Access of the objects in js:

let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 25,
    city: "New York"
};


console.log(person.name) // john

console.log(person["name"]); //john

console.log(person[name]); // error

console.log(person.name);

console.log(person[0]); // undeined


modifications:

person.name="sachin";
console.log(person.name)

person["age"]=90
console.log(person.age)

To add new data  in to the object:

..> Object.assign(person,{country:"usa"})
console.log(person)

##### : 
Reflect.set(person, "city", "Chicago");
console.log(person.city);  // Output: Chicago


.> Reflect.set(target, propertyKey, value, receiver)


let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 25
};

Reflect.set(person, "city", "Chicago");
console.log(person.city);  // Output: Chicago

// # HOW JavaScript Code is Executed:

..> Everything in js happens inside an executions context.


..>it has the two components:

1) memory component /variable environment
..> every thing is stored in the key : value paris

2)  Code component/ Thread of execution :
..> here the code is executed one line at a time , line by line.

..> 


..> "js is a synchronous- single threaded language"

.> which mens here only one command will execute at a time in a specify order:

..> when you run the js code an execution context is created.

..> a GLOBAL ECECUTION CONTEXT is created at two phases:

1) MEMORY CREATION phase:
2) CODE EXECUTION PHASE:






var n=2;
function square(num){
    var ans=num*num;
    return ans
}

var square2=square(n);

var square4=square(4);

here this function will go through  when runned for the first time then:
..> first it will create the Global execution context and in side it , it  will have the 
..> here first memeory execution phase  is made
where memory will be created for all the variables and functions
.> and here every thing will be stored in the key:value pairs
where n:undefined // varible 
square:{...} // whole function code is stored
square2:undefined
square4:undefined

..> In phase two : code execution will be made where it will be go through line by line.

..> 

where n:2 // varible 
square:{...} // whole function code is stored
square2:undefined
square4:undefined


and  when the function reaches to this line :
var square2=square(n); here it will be hit the function call so , here a new Function execution context will be created. in side the code component:

..> and in side this FEC created, again the memeory creation sphase will happens and after this code execution phases will happen, 
    and it will return the 4 in out put and after this return , this FEC will be deleted, 

and next when the function reaches to this line :
var square4 =square(4); here it will be hit the function call so , here a new Function execution context will be created. in side the code component:

..> again a new FEC created, again the memeory creation sphase will happens and after this code execution phases will happen, 
    and it will return the 16 in output and after this return , this FEC will be deleted, 

..> and the First created Global execution context will also be deleted.

...> this complete things will be handled by the 
call stack.




..> Call stack maintains the order of execution of execution contexts"

call Stack
Execution context stack
Program stack
control stack
runtime stack
machine stack



// #) HOISTING IN JS

console.log(x) // undefined ,first in the memory creation phase it will be made to undefined.

..> in this case first it will be sotred the whole function in a variable.
..> when getName is called then we can see the data in the  console.log()

getName() // hai iam sachin reddy
var x=220

function getName(){
    console.log("hai iam sachin reddy!")
}

console.log(getName) 

var getName=()=>{
    console.log("hai iam sachin reddy!")
}


var getName2=function(){
    console.log("hai iam sachin reddy!")
}

..> iam will get the undefined only insted of getting the complete output.

..> Because when we use the arrow function it will be stored has the variable insted of storing has the function so we get has  the undefined.

..> var getName2 here also iam getting the undefined because it is also storing has the varibles only.



// #) HOW FUNCTIONS WORK IN JS


.> 

difference between the undefined and not defined:

console.log(x) // undefined

here undefined means: memory is taken , it is not empty , and this is a special keyword in js.

..> 








window :this window is the global object which is created of the js along with he global execution context.

and this ...> here this is also refers to the window object only.

..>at a global level this points to the this===window .> true

..> any thing which is not inside the function then it will be in global space.


javascript is the loose typed language :

which menas it will not attaches any variables to specific  datatypes 



# Scope Chain Scope$ Lexical Environent :


function a(){
    console.log(x) // 10 here it 
}

var x=10

a()

console.log(this.x) // we get here also 10
console.log(x)
console.log(window.x) // we get here also 10


ex2: 



function a(){
    c();
    function c(){
        console.log(x,"iam from the inside the c") // 10
    }
}

var x=10

a()


console.log(x) //10



scope: it is nothing but at where we can access the variables, functions .

lexical is hierarchy /order

.> lexical environment is the local memory along with the lexical environment of its parent.


scope chain is nothing but finding for the variables in the lexical scopes, of every FEC and when this reference is pointing to others like a chain , when it comes to the global execution chain then here also but it not found then it will be null then we get the error:


lexical enviromment = local memory + lexical environment of the parent( which means again its local memory+ its parent lexical environment )


..> 

# LET & CONST in JS Temporal Dead Zone :
----------------------------------------------->

..>  When the variables in the temporal dead zone we can not access them , it we try to access them then we get the error saying has ReferenceError : Cannot access 'a' Before initialization


..> when we try to access the let, const before its initialization then we get the error.


..> In same way if we try to assign the same variable names with two or more then we get the error


console.log("hai")
let a=10;
let a=20;

Then we get the error here saying that Syntax-error, even the first line also  will not be executed.

..> 



but in case of var , we can assign the two varibles. 

var a=90

var a =89

this can be accepted.


..> NOTE: Let and Const behaviour in the same way for the hoisting.

but 

let a

a=10

console.log(a) // 10 here it is accepted in the let , 

but it is not accepted in the const variable

const b

b=90

console.log(b) we get the error syntax error here.





..> BLock in the js is nothing but the { this space is called block }  

..> Blovk is nothing but waht all the variables and functions which we assecc in side this {} is nothing but the block scope.



{
    let a=10;
    const b=20;
     var c=30
     
     console.log(a,"inside the block"); //10
     console.log(b,"inside the block"); //20
     console.log(c,"inside the block"); //30
}

console.log(c,"outside the block")  //30
console.log(a,"outside the block"); // reference error because here let has only the block scope
console.log(b,"outside the block"); // reference error because here const has only the block scope so we can not access out side the block scope.


...> SHOWDING OF THE VARIABLES:


var c=3000
{
    let a=10;
    const b=20;
     var c=30
     
     console.log(a,"inside the block");
     console.log(b,"inside the block");
     console.log(c,"inside the block") // 30 but not the 3000
}

console.log(c) // here also the 30 , because of teh showding

// here even the var is declared with teh 3000 in top and again this var c is declared with teh 30 , then we get 30 only in the declartions because , here , var c=3000, for this line in the global scope the memoery is asigend for the var c has 3000, but when the line hit the var c=30 , then in the global scope only the 3000 is changed in to teh 30. this is know has the SHOWDING of the variables.


..> here when it comes to the let , it is different here 


let a=3000 // this a is outside the block so 
{
    let a=10;
    const b=20;
     var c=30
     
     console.log(a,"inside the block , its scope is only with in the block only"); // we get 10 here 
     console.log(b,"inside the block");
     console.log(c,"inside the block") 
}

console.log(a) // here we get the 3000


# CLOSURES IN JS :
------------------------------>

..> Closures is the function bundles together ith reference to its surrounding state ( the lexical Environment). 

..> Closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function.

..> In js closure are created every time a function is created , at the function creation time 


..> This is because of the  closures:

function x(){
    var a=20
    function y(){
        console.log(a, "fomr inside")
    }
    return y
}


var z=x()

console.log(z, "the function") // [Function: y] the function


z() // 20 fomr inside


Uses of Closures:

..>Module Design Pattern 
l
..> Currying

..> Functions like once.

..> memorize.

..> maintaining state in async world.

..>SetTimeouts.

..>Iterators


ex:2)


function z() {
    const  b=900
function x(){
    var a=20
    function y(){
        console.log(a, "fomr inside",b) // 20 fomr inside 900
    }
 y()
}
x()
}

z() // 20 fomr inside



--------------------------------------------==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================>



# SetTimeout +Closures:

------------------------------------>

here when we run this code :

function x(){
    for(var i=1;i<=5;i++){
    setTimeout(function(){
       
        console.log(i);
        
        
    },i*1000)
    }
    
    console.log("salam sachin")
    
}

x()

we get the output has the 
6
6
6
6
6

because here the var has the global scope here , and here the i evry time is refereeing the to the same memory locationi, but not the different , so get the 6 here 



AND Here when we  run this know :

function x(){
    for(let  i=1;i<=5;i++){
    setTimeout(function(){
       
        console.log(i);
        
        
    },i*1000)
    }
    
    console.log("salam sachin")
    
}

x()

we get the out put has the :
1
2
3
4
5


..> Here we used the let instead of the var ,  the let has teh block scope,
so every time when the setTimeOut inside function is runned then here the i will be referencing to the  different memory location.
so we get the diff output.

..> 





function x(){
    for(var  i=1;i<=5;i++){
        function close(d){
            
          setTimeout(function(){
       
                console.log(d);
        
                 },d*1000)
        }
        close(i)
    }
    
    console.log("salam sachin")
    
}

x()

// here in this case even we are using the var also we can able to get the output has exepected.

//  because here , every time when we call the close(i) , it is creating the new reference here , but not the same reference
